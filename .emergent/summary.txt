The trajectory documents a multi-phase development cycle for the Vivento application. The initial phase focused on enhancing the  component, successfully implementing a system for admins to add placeholder elements (e.g., date, location) and assign a specific purpose to them via a modal. This work was validated by a frontend testing agent.

The second phase addressed user-reported bugs and feature requests. Key tasks included fixing a critical bug where background images from admin-created templates failed to render in the user-facing . This was resolved by correcting the template loading logic. A significant architectural change was introduced by replacing URL-based image inputs with a file upload system. This involved adding new file upload endpoints to the FastAPI backend (), creating an  directory for static files, and updating the frontend components to handle file selection and API calls. A Next Step workflow was also added to the template editor to guide users toward guest management.

The final, most extensive phase involved deploying the application. The user, initially interested in shared hosting, opted for a modern cloud setup (Railway, Vercel/Netlify, MongoDB Atlas). This phase was fraught with challenges, including invalid API tokens, incorrect build configurations across multiple platforms (Vercel, Netlify), and platform-specific errors related to the project's monorepo structure and use of . The backend was successfully deployed on Render.com after migrating from a problematic Railway setup. The current and final focus is on resolving a persistent build failure for the React frontend on Netlify, with the last proposed solution being the creation of a  configuration file to explicitly define the build environment and commands.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build Vivento, a Paperless Post-like web application for creating and managing digital event invitations. The user interface is required to be in Azerbaijani.

**Core Modules:**
1.  **Authentication:** User registration and login (email/password).
2.  **Event Management:** Users can create events with details like date, time, and location.
3.  **Template System:** A gallery of predefined invitation templates that users can select and customize.
4.  **Canva-like Editor:** A dynamic editor () allowing users to modify text, colors, fonts, and images on a template. Custom designs must be saved and linked to events.
5.  **Invitation Sharing:** Each event generates a unique link for guests.
6.  **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive dashboard for managing users, events, and templates. A key feature is the , allowing administrators to create and edit templates with dynamic placeholders (e.g., Event Date, Location) that are automatically populated with event data for the end-user.

**Implementation Status:**
The core application is functional. User authentication, event creation, and the template editor are implemented. The Admin Panel is operational, and the template builder has been enhanced to support assigning a purpose to elements. A file upload system has replaced previous URL-based image handling. The application is currently in the deployment phase.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript) with Create React App (CRACO)
- **Database:** MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **UI/Editor:** Shadcn UI components, Fabric.js for the canvas editor.
- **Process Management:** Supervisor (for the local dev environment)
- **Deployment Stack:**
    - **Backend Hosting:** Render.com (migrated from Railway)
    - **Frontend Hosting:** Netlify (migrated from Vercel attempts)
    - **Database Hosting:** MongoDB Atlas
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with separate  and  directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core FastAPI application containing all API endpoints for authentication, events, templates, and now, file uploads.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   New endpoints  and  were added to handle file uploads using .
        -   Configuration was added to serve static files from the  directory, allowing uploaded images to be accessed via a URL.
        -   A demo invitation endpoint was added for testing purposes.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The admin-facing tool for creating invitation templates. It's central to the content management strategy.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Major enhancements to allow admins to add placeholder elements (like Date, Location).
        -   A modal was implemented for assigning a purpose to each canvas element, linking it to a specific event data field.
        -   Input fields for image URLs were replaced with file upload components that call the new backend upload endpoints.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main user-facing Canva-like editor where users customize their invitations.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   The  function was fixed to correctly apply the  property from templates created in the Admin Panel, resolving a major bug.
        -   A Next Step button and a corresponding modal were added to create a workflow for users to proceed to guest management after completing their design.
        -   Image URL inputs were replaced with file upload functionality.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new configuration file created to resolve persistent build failures on Netlify.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Created to explicitly define the build settings for the monorepo structure. It tells Netlify that the frontend code is in the  directory (), specifies the build command, and sets the publish directory. It also sets the required Node.js version to solve dependency issues.
        
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve the final frontend deployment issue on Netlify to make the application fully live.
- Update the GitHub repository with all the fixes and configurations () to ensure a stable, deployable main branch.
- Implement the Next Step functionality beyond the UI modal (e.g., guest list creation, sharing options).
- Fulfill remaining product requirements like payment integration, full RSVP tracking, and advanced Admin CMS features.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate task is to fix the failing frontend deployment on Netlify. The backend is successfully deployed and operational on Render.com, and the MongoDB Atlas database is correctly configured and connected. However, the Netlify build process for the frontend is consistently failing.

The troubleshooting process has revealed several underlying issues:
1.  **Incorrect Build Settings:** Initial attempts failed because Netlify's default settings didn't account for the project's monorepo structure (i.e., the React app being inside the  sub-directory).
2.  **Node.js Version Incompatibility:** A  dependency required Node.js v20+, while the Netlify build environment was defaulting to v18, causing an  failure.

The last and most current action was to create a  configuration file at the root of the repository. This file explicitly instructs the Netlify build system to:
-   Use  as the base directory.
-   Run the correct build command ().
-   Use Node.js version 20.

The user has reported that the error persists even after these changes, indicating that the  file might not have been correctly added to the GitHub repository or that another issue is present. The work is paused pending the resolution of this final deployment blocker.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify that the  file exists in the root of the  GitHub repository and that its contents are correct, then trigger another manual deploy on Netlify to confirm if the build error is resolved.
